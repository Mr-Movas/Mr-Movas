</ul>  

<h3>Journey</h3>
<p>
Discord bots were the beginning for me to learn nodejs 3 years ago,
</p><p>
working on projects I learned the logic of how can I solve problems in programming,
</p><p>
I learned how to work with data,
 </p><p>
I learned how can I use a database,
</p><p>
after I learned those 3 things I was in a moment where I had to update a lot of things to the projects I had then, a JSON file for each project that I was manually changing and I was restarting the apps so I can make the changes needed, of course, that was not good because I could close the program in the middle of a process, I made for each project something that I still do it, a dashboard that I can update automatically everything from it using a database and the logic of how to handle with the data to save me time.
</p><p>
While making the dashboard I learned how to work with express so I could handle the requests of the changes I wanted to do to my apps from the browser, that made me learn about HTTP requests and it helped me make my applications to be able to communicate with each other when I needed them to.
</p><p>
When it came to using other APIs that did not have libraries like discord had, I easily was able to work with them because the dashboard and the communications between my applications that I mentioned were working very familiar with how the APIs were.
</p><p>
Working with the APIs I also learned how to use WebSockets.
</p>
<p>
Working with WebSockets was the same as using the listeners that the libraries that I have used had, after you set up a WebSocket the way you handle the given data was the same as handling the data from the messageCreate event in discord.js or when a tweet is made when using the Twitter API library and many other examples.
</p>
<p>
Working on so many projects all these years and still working, I find myself cabable of understanding and being able to work with projects that have do to with the backend and handling data.
